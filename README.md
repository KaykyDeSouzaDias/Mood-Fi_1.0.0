# About the project

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59856984/160259934-057ca176-c4be-4af9-8883-226459f7fb29.gif">

<h1>Everything in one place!</h1>

Mood-Fi is the best place to relax and listen to a lo-fi live stream. It's a free software app with 30+ lo-fi live streams between 8 different lo-fi types. Take a break, relax and be mood, be Mood-Fi.

The app would be a desktop development study. However, after some time developing, I decided to make it a free software product to collaborate and discover more ideas for the app with feedbacks.

Therefore, this project is on GPLv3. So, be free to share your knowledge, study the project, write some feedback and, maybe, do your app version.
